#Final Spotify Fantasy Project

## A fun personal project utilizing Python, Flask, and Spotify API to give the user some cool feedback about their listening tendencies!

I would see websites like receiptify that allow the user to access their spotify and in return get some information about their account presented in a fun way. I wanted to be able to create something similar to that. My own spin on it is that I have recently been playing Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth. I always loved the original and because of that I wanted my UI to look a lot like how the orignal game menu's did. While everyone may not get the theme I think it still looks pretty cool and those who do get it, will enjoy the styling choices.

## How to set up this project

1. Clone this project
2. Make sure you have Flask and Spotipy API installed

```
py -m pip install flask
py -m pip install spotipy
```

3. Make a .env file in the root directory
4. Go to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/)
